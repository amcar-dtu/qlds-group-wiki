Quantum Photonics of Low-Dimensional Systems (QLDS) group Wiki
======================================================================

In the `Quantum Photonics of Low-Dimensional Systems group <https://electro.dtu.dk/research/research-areas/nanophotonics/quantum-photonics-of-low-dimensional-systems>`_ at DTU Electro we try to discover new ways to use light, and we study how to create ever smaller light sources to meet the world's need for communication technologies in a more energy-friendly way.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
